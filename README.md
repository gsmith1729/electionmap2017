# electionmap2017
A constituency map of the UK after the 2017 general election coloured by who holds the seat.
Blank Map from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UK_Constituencies_2017_(blank).svg (although this was modified quite a bit)
The map uploaded here is quite a bit better because the titles have all been corrected.
The python script extacts the data from the spreadsheet and puts in a form which is copy and pasted to the js. It is only included for completeness
